also_build_ash_chrome
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/ui_mode.gni:26

    Setting this to true when building linux Lacros-chrome will cause it to
    *also* build linux ash-chrome in a subdirectory using an alternate
    toolchain.
    Don't set this unless you're sure you want it, because it'll double
    your build time.

also_build_lacros_chrome
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/ui_mode.gni:30

    Setting this to true when building linux ash-chrome will cause it to
    *also* build linux Lacros-chrome in a subdirectory using an alternate toolchain.

also_build_lacros_chrome_for_architecture
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/chromeos/ui_mode.gni:35

    Setting this when building ash-chrome will cause it to
    *also* build Lacros-chrome in a subdirectory using an alternate toolchain.
    You can set this to either "amd64" or "arm".

android_full_debug
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:60

    Normally, Android builds are lightly optimized, even for debug builds, to
    keep binary size down. Setting this flag to true disables such optimization

apm_debug_dump

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libsrtp/BUILD.gn:10

    Tests may not be appropriate for some build environments, e.g. Windows.
    Rather than enumerate valid options, we just let clients ask for them.

build_with_mozilla
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:144

    Enable to use the Mozilla internal settings.

cc_wrapper
    Current value (from the default) = ""

      From //build/config/compiler/pgo/pgo.gni:14

    Specify the current PGO phase.
    Here's the different values that can be used:
        0 : Means that PGO is turned off.
        1 : Used during the PGI (instrumentation) phase.
        2 : Used during the PGO (optimization) phase.

chromecast_branding
    Current value (from the default) = "public"
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:21

    chromecast_branding is used to include or exclude Google-branded components.
    Set it to "public" for a Chromium build.
    TODO(crbug.com/1293517): Remove usages in Chromium and move to //chromecast.

chromeos_afdo_platform
    Current value (from the default) = "atom"
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:109

    This configuration is used to select a default profile in Chrome OS based on
    the microarchitectures we are using. This is only used if
    clang_use_default_sample_profile is true and clang_sample_profile_path is
    empty.

chromeos_is_browser_only
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/ui_mode.gni:19

    Deprecated, use is_lacros.
   
    This controls UI configuration for Chrome.
    If this flag is set, we assume Chrome runs on Chrome OS devices, using
    Wayland (instead of X11).
   
    TODO(crbug.com/1052397):
    Define chromeos_product instead, which takes either "browser" or "ash".
    Re-define the following variables as:
    is_lacros = chromeos_product == "browser"

    Emit debug information for profiling wile building with clang.

clang_sample_profile_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:93

    Path to an AFDO profile to use while building with clang, if any. Empty
    implies none.

clang_use_chrome_plugins

      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:36

compiler_timing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:115

    Turn this on to have the compiler output extra timing information.

compute_build_timestamp
    Current value (from the default) = "compute_build_timestamp.py"
      From //build/timestamp.gni:17

    This should be the filename of a script that prints a single line
    containing an integer that's a unix timestamp in UTC.
    This timestamp is used as build time and will be compiled into
    other code.
   
    This argument may look unused. Before removing please check with the
    chromecast team to see if they still use it internally.

concurrent_links
    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/toolchain/concurrent_links.gni:23

    Limit the number of concurrent links; we often want to run fewer
    links at once than we do compiles, because linking is memory-intensive.
    The default to use varies by platform and by the amount of memory
    available, so we call out to a script to get the right value.

coverage_instrumentation_input_file
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/coverage/coverage.gni:36

    The path to the coverage instrumentation input file should be a source root
    absolute path (e.g. //out/Release/coverage_instrumentation_input.txt), and
    the file consists of multiple lines where each line represents a path to a
    source file, and the paths must be relative to the root build directory.
    e.g. ../../base/task/post_task.cc for build directory 'out/Release'.
   
    NOTE that this arg will be non-op if use_clang_coverage is false.

cros_board
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:8

    This is used only by Simple Chrome to bind its value to test-runner scripts
    generated at build-time.

cros_sdk_version
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:12

    Similar to cros_board above, this used only by test-runner scripts in
    Simple Chrome.

current_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      (Internally set; try `gn help current_cpu`.)

current_os
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      (Internally set; try `gn help current_os`.)

custom_toolchain
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:147

    Allows the path to a custom target toolchain to be injected as a single
    argument, and set as the default toolchain.

dcheck_always_on
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/dcheck_always_on.gni:25

dcheck_is_configurable
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/dcheck_always_on.gni:14

    Enables DCHECKs to be built-in, but to default to being non-fatal/log-only.
    DCHECKS can then be set as fatal/non-fatal via the "DcheckIsFatal" feature.
    See https://bit.ly/dcheck-albatross for details on how this is used.

devtools_grd_location
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/devtools.gni:35

devtools_location
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/devtools.gni:33

    DevTools is building a standalone version

devtools_root_location
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/devtools.gni:34

disable_libfuzzer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:86

    Helper variable for testing builds with disabled libfuzzer.
    Not for client use.

enable_base_tracing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:52

    WebRTC doesn't depend on //base from production code but only for testing
    purposes. In any case, it doesn't depend on //third_party/perfetto which
    is used for base tracing, so this feature is disabled.

enable_call_graph_profile_sort
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:162

    Turn off the --call-graph-profile-sort flag for lld by default. Enable
    selectively for targets where it's beneficial.

enable_cast_audio_renderer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:38

    True to enable the cast audio renderer.
   
    TODO(crbug.com/1293520): Remove this buildflag.

enable_cast_receiver
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:47

    Set this true for a Chromecast build. Chromecast builds are supported on
    Linux, Android, ChromeOS, and Fuchsia.
   
    During the migration from is_chromecast, this must be set to the same value
    as is_chromecast.

enable_cast_renderer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:66

enable_cet_shadow_stack
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:131

    Mark binaries as compatible with Shadow Stack of Control-flow Enforcement
    Technology (CET). If Windows version and hardware supports the feature and
    it's enabled by OS then additional validation of return address will be
    performed as mitigation against Return-oriented programming (ROP).
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/design/sandbox.md#cet-shadow-stack

enable_dsyms
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/apple/symbols.gni:17

    Produce dSYM files for targets that are configured to do so. dSYM
    generation is controlled globally as it is a linker output (produced via
    the //build/toolchain/apple/linker_driver.py. Enabling this will result in
    all shared library, loadable module, and executable targets having a dSYM
    generated.

enable_expensive_dchecks
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/dcheck_always_on.gni:30

    Set to false to disable EXPENSIVE_DCHECK()s.

enable_full_stack_frames_for_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:67

    Compile in such a way as to make it possible for the profiler to unwind full
    stack frames. Setting this flag has a large effect on the performance of the
    generated code than just setting profiling, but gives the profiler more
    information to analyze.
    Requires profiling to be set to true.

enable_google_benchmarks
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/google_benchmark/buildconfig.gni:11

    Google Benchmark is not checked out by default, because it is only used by
    a few specialized benchmarks that most developers do not interact with.

enable_iterator_debugging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:41

    When set, enables libc++ debug mode with iterator debugging.
   
    Iterator debugging is generally useful for catching bugs. But it can
    introduce extra locking to check the state of an iterator against the state
    of the current object. For iterator- and thread-heavy code, this can
    significantly slow execution - two orders of magnitude slowdown has been
    seen (crbug.com/903553) and iterator debugging also slows builds by making
    generation of snapshot_blob.bin take ~40-60 s longer. Therefore this
    defaults to off.

enable_js_protobuf
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/protobuf/proto_library.gni:145

    Allows subprojects to omit javascript dependencies (e.g.) closure_compiler
    and google-closure-library.

enable_js_type_check
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/closure_compiler/compile_js.gni:11

    Enable closure type-checking for Chrome's web technology-based UI. This
    enables the webui_closure_compile target which does a no-op without this
    flag enabled. Requires Java.

enable_kythe_annotations
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/kythe.gni:10

    Enables Kythe annotations necessary to build cross references.

enable_libaom
    Current value = true
      From //.gn:62
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //third_party/libaom/options.gni:7

    Enable encoding and decoding AV1 video files.

enable_libaom_decoder
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libaom/options.gni:10

    To be deprecated soon.

enable_modular_updater
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:33

    Set true to enable modular_updater.

enable_opengl_apitrace
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:35

    Enable explicit apitrace (https://apitrace.github.io) loading.
    This requires apitrace library with additional bindings.
    See ChromeOS package for details:
    https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/2659419
    Chrome will not start without an apitrace.so library.
    Trace will be saved to /tmp/gltrace.dat file by default. You can
    override it at run time with TRACE_FILE=<path> environment variable.

enable_paint_preview
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/buildflags_paint_preview.gni:15

    Enable basic paint preview support. Does not work on iOS. Should
    not be included with Chromecast.
    Used by //components/paint_preview and //third_party/harfbuzz-ng.
    TODO(crbug.com/webrtc/11223) Move back this file in
    //components/paint_preview/ once WebRTC doesn't roll harfbuzz-ng anymore,
    for consistency sake.

enable_precompiled_headers
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/pch.gni:14

enable_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:69

    Compile in such a way as to enable profiling of the generated code. For
    example, don't omit the frame pointer and leave in symbols.

enable_rust
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/rust.gni:17

    Whether to allow Rust code to be part of the Chromium *build process*.
    This can be used to create Rust test binaries, even if the flag below
    is false.

enable_segment_heap
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/manifest.gni:46

enable_stripping
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/apple/symbols.gni:24

    Strip symbols from linked targets by default. If this is enabled, the
    //build/config/mac:strip_all config will be applied to all linked targets.
    If custom stripping parameters are required, remove that config from a
    linked target and apply custom -Wcrl,strip flags. See
    //build/toolchain/apple/linker_driver.py for more information.

enable_wmax_tokens
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:154

exclude_unwind_tables
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:120

    Exclude unwind tables by default for official builds as unwinding can be
    done from stack dumps produced by Crashpad at a later time "offline" in the
    crash server. Since this increases binary size, we don't recommend including
    them in shipping builds.
    For unofficial (e.g. development) builds and non-Chrome branded (e.g. Cronet
    which doesn't use Crashpad, crbug.com/479283) builds it's useful to be able
    to unwind at runtime.
    Include the unwind tables on Android even for official builds, as otherwise
    the crash dumps generated by Android's debuggerd are largely useless, and
    having this additional mechanism to understand issues is particularly helpful
    to WebView.

fatal_linker_warnings
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:75

    Enable fatal linker warnings. Building Chromium with certain versions
    of binutils can cause linker warning.

forbid_non_component_debug_builds
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:107

    Whether an error should be raised on attempts to make debug builds with
    is_component_build=false. Very large debug symbols can have unwanted side
    effects so this is enforced by default for chromium.

generate_fuzzer_owners
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:166

    Generates an owners file for each fuzzer test.
    TODO(crbug.com/1194183): Remove this arg when finding OWNERS is faster.

generate_linker_map
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:21

    Used for binary size analysis.

gold_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:71

    When we are going to use gold we need to find it.
    This is initialized below, after use_gold might have been overridden.

goma_dir
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:17

    Absolute directory containing the gomacc binary.

gtest_enable_absl_printers
    Current value = true
      From //.gn:64
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:64

    If true, it assumes that //third_party/abseil-cpp is an available
    dependency for googletest.

gtk_version
    Current value (from the default) = 3
      From //build/config/linux/gtk/gtk.gni:13

    The (major) version of GTK to build against.  A different version may be
    loaded at runtime.

host_byteorder
    Current value (from the default) = "undefined"
      From //build/config/host_byteorder.gni:9

host_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = "x64"
      (Internally set; try `gn help host_cpu`.)

host_os
    Current value (from the default) = "win"
      (Internally set; try `gn help host_os`.)

host_pkg_config
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:36

    A optional pkg-config wrapper to use for tools built on the host.

host_toolchain
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:151

    This should not normally be set as a build argument.  It's here so that
    every toolchain can pass through the "global" value via toolchain_args().

icu_disable_thin_archive
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/icu/config.gni:17

    If true, compile icu into a standalone static library. Currently this is
    only useful on Chrome OS.

icu_fuchsia_override_data_dir
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //third_party/icu/config.gni:22

    If set to nonempty, this is the label of the directory to be used to pull
    the ICU data files content.  The setting has effect only when building
    inside the Fuchsia source tree.

icu_use_data_file
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/icu/config.gni:8

    Tells icu to load an external data file rather than rely on the icudata
    being linked directly into the binary.

icu_use_stub_data
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/icu/config.gni:13

    If true, then this creates a stub data file. This should be disabled if
    a custom data file will be used instead, in order to avoid conflicting
    symbols.

init_stack_vars
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:140

    Initialize all local variables with a pattern. This flag will fill
    uninitialized floating-point types (and 32-bit pointers) with 0xFF and the
    rest with 0xAA. This makes behavior of uninitialized memory bugs consistent,
    recognizable in the debugger, and crashes on memory accesses through
    uninitialized pointers.
   
    TODO(crbug.com/1131993): Enabling this when 'is_android' is true breaks
    content_shell_test_apk on both ARM and x86.

ios_deployment_target
    Current value = "12.0"
      From //.gn:52
    Overridden from the default = "14.0"

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:14

    Compile for Address Sanitizer to find memory bugs.

is_cast_android
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:57

    Set this to true to build for Android-based Cast devices.
    Set this to false to use the defaults for the target OS/platform.

is_cast_audio_only
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:26

    Set this true for an audio-only Chromecast build.
    TODO(crbug.com/1293538): Replace with a buildflag for speaker-only builds not
    specific to Cast.

is_castos
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:53

    Set this to true to build for Nest hardware running Linux (aka "CastOS").
    Set this to false to use the defaults for the target OS/platform.
   
    TODO(crbug.com/1314528): Change default to false

is_cfi
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:53

    Compile with Control Flow Integrity to protect virtual calls and casts.
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html
   
    TODO(pcc): Remove this flag if/when CFI is enabled in all official builds.

is_chrome_branded
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chrome_build.gni:9

    Select the desired branding flavor. False means normal Chromium branding,
    true means official Google Chrome branding (requires extra Google-internal
    resources).

is_chromecast
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:16

    DEPRECATED.  This flag will be removed in the future; see https://crbug.com/1219802.
   
    New code should use enable_cast_receiver if the feature in question is
    required for all Cast-enabled browsers, or an alternative buildflag if it is
    for specific types of devices.

is_chromeos_device
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:26

    Determines if we're building for a Chrome OS device (or VM) and not just
    linux-chromeos. NOTE: Most test targets in Chrome expect to run under
    linux-chromeos, so some have compile-time asserts that intentionally fail
    when this build flag is set. Build and run the tests for linux-chromeos
    instead.

is_chromeos_with_hw_details
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:34

    Determines if we collect hardware information in chrome://system and
    feedback logs. A similar build flag "hw_details" is defined in Chrome OS
    (see https://crrev.com/c/3123455).

is_clang
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:139

    Set to true when compiling with the Clang compiler.

is_component_build
    Current value = false
      From //.gn:48
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:168

    Component build. Setting to true compiles targets declared as "components"
    as shared libraries loaded dynamically. This speeds up development time.
    When false, components will be linked statically.
   
    For more information see
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/component_build.md

is_cronet_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ios/config.gni:16

    Control whether cronet is built (this is usually set by the script
    components/cronet/tools/cr_cronet.py as cronet requires specific
    gn args to build correctly).

is_debug
    Current value = true
      From /C:/source/WebRtcNet/third-party/google/webrtc/out/Debug/x64/args.gn:2
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:158

    Debug build. Enabling official builds automatically sets is_debug to false.

is_hwasan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:19

    Compile for Hardware-Assisted Address Sanitizer to find memory bugs
    (android/arm64 only).
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.html

is_lsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:22

    Compile for Leak Sanitizer to find leaks.

is_msan
    Current value (from the default) = false

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/nacl/config.gni:12

    True if nacl_glibc is used.

is_nacl_saigo
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/nacl/config.gni:15

    True if saigo_newlib is used.

is_official_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:136

    Set to enable the official build level of optimization. This has nothing
    to do with branding, but enables an additional level of optimization above
    release (!is_debug). This might be better expressed as a tri-state
    (debug, release, official) but for historical reasons there are two
    separate flags.
   
    IMPORTANT NOTE: (!is_debug) is *not* sufficient to get satisfying
    performance. In particular, DCHECK()s are still enabled for release builds,
    which can halve overall performance, and do increase memory usage. Always
    set "is_official_build" to true for any build intended to ship to end-users.

is_reven
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:40

    Refers to the separate branding required for the reven build.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:29

    Determines if we run the test in skylab, aka the CrOS labs.

is_tsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:28

    Compile for Thread Sanitizer to find threading bugs.

is_ubsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:32

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer to find various types of
    undefined behaviour (excludes vptr checks).

is_ubsan_no_recover

      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:38

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer's null pointer checks.

is_ubsan_security
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:82

    Enables core ubsan security features. Will later be removed once it matches
    is_ubsan.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:118

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer's vptr checks.

jsoncpp_no_deprecated_declarations
    Current value = false
      From //.gn:70
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //third_party/jsoncpp/BUILD.gn:11

    Allow individual projects to remove the warning suppression
    by overriding this in their .gn file or through custom args.gn
    See crbug.com/983223

libcxx_is_shared
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:55

    WARNING: Setting this to a non-default value is highly discouraged.
    If true, libc++ will be built as a shared library; otherwise libc++ will be
    linked statically. Setting this to something other than the default is
    unsupported and can be broken by libc++ rolls. Note that if this is set to
    true, you must also set libcxx_abi_unstable=false, which is bad for
    performance and memory use.

libcxx_natvis_include
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:30

    Builds libcxx Natvis into the symbols for type visualization.
    Set to false to workaround http://crbug.com/966676 and
    http://crbug.com/966687.

libcxx_revision
    Current value (from the default) = "b1269813eaf5b8ac78e35e45a0f7cc320bd3e7d6"
      From //buildtools/deps_revisions.gni:8

    Used to cause full rebuilds on libc++ rolls. This should be kept in sync
    with the libcxx_revision vars in //DEPS.

libyuv_disable_jpeg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:15

libyuv_include_tests
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:14

libyuv_symbols_visible
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/BUILD.gn:19

    When building a shared library using a target in WebRTC or
    Chromium projects that depends on libyuv, setting this flag
    to true makes libyuv symbols visible inside that library.

libyuv_use_absl_flags
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/libyuv/BUILD.gn:14

    Set to false to disable building with absl flags.

libyuv_use_mmi
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:22

libyuv_use_msa
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:20

libyuv_use_neon
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:17

limit_android_deps
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:60

    Limits the defined //third_party/android_deps targets to only "buildCompile"
    and "buildCompileNoDeps" targets. This is useful for third-party
    repositories which do not use JUnit tests. For instance,
    limit_android_deps == true removes "gn gen" requirement for
    //third_party/robolectric .

llvm_force_head_revision
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:18

    If this is set to true, we use the revision in the llvm repo to determine
    the CLANG_REVISION to use, instead of the version hard-coded into
    //tools/clang/scripts/update.py. This should only be used in
    conjunction with setting the llvm_force_head_revision DEPS variable when
    `gclient runhooks` is run as well.

mac_sdk_min
    Current value = "10.12"
      From //.gn:50
    Overridden from the default = "10.15"
      From //build/config/mac/mac_sdk_overrides.gni:12

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/mips.gni:13

    MIPS MultiMedia Instruction compilation flag.

msan_track_origins
    Current value (from the default) = 2
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:43

    Track where uninitialized memory originates from. From fastest to slowest:
    0 - no tracking, 1 - track only the initial allocation site, 2 - track the
    chain of stores leading from allocation site to use site.

needs_gomacc_path_arg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:14

    This flag is for ChromeOS compiler wrapper.
    By passing gomacc path via cmd-line arg, ChromeOS' compiler wrapper
    invokes gomacc inside it.

optimize_for_fuzzing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:90

    Optimize for coverage guided fuzzing (balance between speed and number of
    branches). Can be also used to remove non-determinism and other issues.

optimize_for_size
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:137

    If true, optimize for size. Does not affect windows builds.
    Linux & Mac favor speed over size.
    TODO(brettw) it's weird that Mac and desktop Linux are different. We should
    explore favoring size over speed in this case as well.

ozone_auto_platforms
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:22

    Select platforms automatically. Turn this off for manual control.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:56

    Compile the 'flatland' platform.

ozone_platform_gbm
    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:26

    TODO(petermcneeley): Backwards compatiblity support for VM images.
    Remove when deprecated. (https://crbug.com/1122009)

ozone_platform_headless
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:50

    Compile the 'headless' platform.

ozone_platform_scenic
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:53

    Compile the 'scenic' platform.

ozone_platform_wayland
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:62

    Compile the 'wayland' platform.

ozone_platform_x11
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:59

    Compile the 'x11' platform.

pgo_data_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/pgo/pgo.gni:24

    When using chrome_pgo_phase = 2, read profile data from this path.

pkg_config
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:33

    A pkg-config wrapper to call instead of trying to find and call the right
    pkg-config directly. Wrappers like this are common in cross-compilation
    environments.
    Leaving it blank defaults to searching PATH for 'pkg-config' and relying on
    the sysroot mechanism to find the right .pc files.

proprietary_codecs
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:26

    Enables proprietary codecs and demuxers; e.g. H264, AAC, MP3, and MP4.
    We always build Google Chrome and Chromecast with proprietary codecs.
   
    Note: this flag is used by WebRTC which is DEPSed into Chrome. Moving it
    out of //build will require using the build_overrides directory.

    Rust toolchain. Typically used with 'use_unverified_rust_toolchain' = true

rtc_audio_device_plays_sinus_tone
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:191

    When set to true, replace the audio output with a sinus tone at 440Hz.
    The ADM will ask for audio data from WebRTC but instead of reading real
    audio samples from NetEQ, a sinus tone will be generated and replace the
    real audio samples.

    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:307

    Enable the dcsctp backend for DataChannels and related unittests

      From //webrtc.gni:129

    Set this to false to skip building tools.

rtc_build_with_neon
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:165

rtc_builtin_ssl_root_certificates
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:88

    Setting this to false will require the API user to pass in their own
    SSLCertificateVerifier to verify the certificates presented from a
    TLS-TURN server. In return disabling this saves around 100kb in the binary.

rtc_disable_check_msg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:295

    Set this to true to disable detailed error message and logging for

    Set this to true to disable trace events.

rtc_dlog_always_on
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:51

    Setting this to true, will make RTC_DLOG() expand to log statements instead
    of being removed by the preprocessor.
    This is useful for example to be able to get RTC_DLOGs on a release build.

rtc_enable_android_aaudio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:148

    Experimental: enable use of Android AAudio which requires Android SDK 26 or above

      From //webrtc.gni:257

rtc_enable_objc_symbol_export
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:58

    Setting this to true will make RTC_OBJC_EXPORT expand to code that will
    manage symbols visibility. By default, Obj-C/Obj-C++ symbols are exported
    if C++ symbols are but setting this arg to true while keeping
    rtc_enable_symbol_export=false will only export RTC_OBJC_EXPORT
    annotated symbols.

rtc_enable_protobuf
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:241

    Enables the use of protocol buffers for debug recordings.

rtc_enable_sctp
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:244

    Set this to disable building with support for SCTP data channels.

rtc_enable_symbol_export
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:44

    Setting this to true will make RTC_EXPORT (see rtc_base/system/rtc_export.h)
    expand to code that will manage symbols visibility.

rtc_enable_win_wgc
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:226

    When set to true, a capturer implementation that uses the
    Windows.Graphics.Capture APIs will be available for use. This introduces a
    dependency on the Win 10 SDK v10.0.17763.0.

      From //webrtc.gni:70

rtc_exclude_metrics_default
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:77

    Setting this to true will define WEBRTC_EXCLUDE_METRICS_DEFAULT which
    will tell the pre-processor to remove the default definition of symbols
    needed to use metrics. In that case a new implementation needs to be
    provided.

rtc_exclude_system_time
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:83

    Setting this to true will define WEBRTC_EXCLUDE_SYSTEM_TIME which
    will tell the pre-processor to remove the default definition of the
    SystemTimeNanos() which is defined in rtc_base/system_time.cc. In
    that case a new implementation needs to be provided.

rtc_exclude_transient_suppressor
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:302

    Set this to true to exclude the transient suppressor in the audio processing
    module from the build.

    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:207

    When set to false, builtin audio encoder/decoder factories and all the
    audio codecs they depend on will not be included in libwebrtc.{a|lib}
    (they will still be included in libjingle_peerconnection_so.so and
    WebRTC.framework)

rtc_include_builtin_video_codecs
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:213

    When set to false, builtin video encoder/decoder factories and all the
    video codecs they depends on will not be included in libwebrtc.{a|lib}
    (they will still be included in libjingle_peerconnection_so.so and
    WebRTC.framework)

rtc_include_dav1d_in_internal_decoder_factory
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:229

    Includes the dav1d decoder in the internal decoder factory when set to true.

rtc_include_ilbc
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:91

    Include the iLBC audio codec?

rtc_include_internal_audio_device
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:269

    Chromium uses its own IO handling, so the internal ADM is only built for
    standalone WebRTC.

rtc_include_opus
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:94

    Disable this to avoid building the Opus audio codec.

rtc_include_pulse_audio
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:265

    Excluded in Chromium since its prerequisites don't require Pulse Audio.

rtc_include_tests
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:281

    Set this to true to build the unit tests.
    Disabled when building with Chromium or Mozilla.

      From //webrtc.gni:105

    Used to specify an external Jsoncpp include path when not compiling the
    library that comes with WebRTC (i.e. rtc_build_json == 0).

rtc_libvpx_build_vp9
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //webrtc.gni:250

rtc_link_pipewire
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:141

    At unit test runtime set UBSAN_OPTIONS="coverage=1".
    It is recommend to set include_examples=0.
    Use llvm's sancov -html-report for human readable reports.
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html .

rtc_ssl_root
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //webrtc.gni:109

    Used to specify an external OpenSSL include path when not compiling the
    library that comes with WebRTC (i.e. rtc_build_ssl == 0).

rtc_use_absl_mutex
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:181

    Enable this flag to make webrtc::Mutex be implemented by absl::Mutex.

rtc_use_dummy_audio_file_devices
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:185

    By default, use normal platform audio support or dummy audio, but don't
    use file-based audio playout and record.

rtc_use_h264
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:178

rtc_use_pipewire
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:138

    Set this to use PipeWire on the Wayland display server.
    By default it's only enabled on desktop Linux (excludes ChromeOS) and
    only when using the sysroot as PipeWire is not available in older and
    supported Ubuntu and Debian distributions.

rtc_use_x11
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:132

    Set this to false to skip building code that requires X11.

rtc_use_x11_extensions
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:285

    Set this to false to skip building code that also requires X11 extensions
    such as Xdamage, Xfixes.

rtc_win_undef_unicode
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //webrtc.gni:221

    When set to true and in a standalone build, it will undefine UNICODE and
    _UNICODE (which are always defined globally by the Chromium Windows
    toolchain).
    This is only needed for testing purposes, WebRTC wants to be sure it
    doesn't assume /DUNICODE and /D_UNICODE but that it explicitly uses
    wide character functions.

rust_sysroot_absolute
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/rust.gni:40

    Chromium currently has a Rust toolchain for Android and Linux, but
    if you wish to experiment on more platforms you can use this
    argument to specify an alternative toolchain.
    This should be an absolute path to a directory
    containing a 'bin' directory and others. Commonly
    <home dir>/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-<something>-<something>

rustc_can_link
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/rust.gni:73

    Rust code may end up being linked into a final executable by:
    * rustc (which calls lld)
    * our pre-existing C++ linker invocations
    At the moment, this first pipeline is incompatible with the ldflags we use
    for thin LTO, due to some problem in escaping gn rules. There's a further
    problem with -lunwind on Android.
    However, Rust code is still useful if it's contributing to our existing
    C++ linker invocations, so this doesn't disable Rust entirely. It does
    disable Rust unit test executables, so we do need to fix this.
    https://crbug.com/1229423
    NB this may be overridden by individual toolchains

rustc_version
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/rust.gni:32

    The version string returned by rustc -V, if using an alternative toolchain.

sample_profile_is_accurate
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:147

    Whether we should consider the profile we're using to be accurate. Accurate
    profiles have the benefit of (potentially substantial) binary size
    reductions, by instructing the compiler to optimize cold and uncovered
    functions heavily for size. This often comes at the cost of performance.

sanitizer_coverage_flags
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:100

    Value for -fsanitize-coverage flag. Setting this causes
    use_sanitizer_coverage to be enabled.
    This flag is not used for libFuzzer (use_libfuzzer=true). Instead, we use:
        -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link
    Default value when unset and use_fuzzing_engine=true:
        trace-pc-guard
    Default value when unset and use_sanitizer_coverage=true:
        trace-pc-guard,indirect-calls

show_includes
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:177

    Enable -H, which prints the include tree during compilation.
    For use by tools/clang/scripts/analyze_includes.py

strip_debug_info
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:65

    Android-only: Strip the debug info of libraries within lib.unstripped to
    reduce size. As long as symbol_level > 0, this will still allow stacks to be
    symbolized.

symbol_level
    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:60

    How many symbols to include in the build. This affects the performance of
    the build since the symbols are large and dealing with them is slow.
      2 means regular build with symbols.
      1 means minimal symbols, usually enough for backtraces only. Symbols with
    internal linkage (static functions or those in anonymous namespaces) may not
    appear when using this level.
      0 means no symbols.
      -1 means auto-set according to debug/release and platform.

sysroot
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/sysroot.gni:20

    The path of the sysroot for the current toolchain. If empty, default
    sysroot is used.

system_libdir
    Current value (from the default) = "lib"
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:47

    CrOS systemroots place pkgconfig files at <systemroot>/usr/share/pkgconfig
    and one of <systemroot>/usr/lib/pkgconfig or <systemroot>/usr/lib64/pkgconfig
    depending on whether the systemroot is for a 32 or 64 bit architecture.
   
    When build under GYP, CrOS board builds specify the 'system_libdir' variable
    as part of the GYP_DEFINES provided by the CrOS emerge build or simple
    chrome build scheme. This variable permits controlling this for GN builds
    in similar fashion by setting the `system_libdir` variable in the build's
    args.gn file to 'lib' or 'lib64' as appropriate for the target architecture.

target_cpu
    Current value = "x64"
      From /C:/source/WebRtcNet/third-party/google/webrtc/out/Debug/x64/args.gn:1
    Overridden from the default = ""
      (Internally set; try `gn help target_cpu`.)

target_environment
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/ios/config.gni:11

    Configure the environment for which to build. Could be either "device",
    "simulator" or "catalyst". If unspecified, then it will be assumed to be
    "simulator" if the target_cpu is "x68" or "x64", "device" otherwise. The
    default is only there for compatibility reasons and will be removed (see
    crbug.com/1138425 for more details).

target_os
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      (Internally set; try `gn help target_os`.)

target_rpath
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:30

    If non empty, rpath of executables is set to this.
    If empty, default value is used.

target_sysroot
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/sysroot.gni:13

    The path of the sysroot that is applied when compiling using the target
    toolchain.

target_sysroot_dir
    Current value (from the default) = "//build/linux"
      From //build/config/sysroot.gni:16

    The path to directory containing linux sysroot images.

target_winuwp_family
    Current value (from the default) = "app"
      From //build/config/win/BUILD.gn:34

    possible values:
      "app" - Windows Store Applications
      "phone" - Windows Phone Applications
      "system" - Windows Drivers and Tools
      "server" - Windows Server Applications
      "desktop" - Windows Desktop Applications

target_winuwp_version
    Current value (from the default) = "10"
      From //build/config/win/BUILD.gn:26

    possible values for target_winuwp_version:
      "10" - Windows UWP 10
      "8.1" - Windows RT 8.1
      "8.0" - Windows RT 8.0

tests_have_location_tags
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //testing/test.gni:23

    Some component repos (e.g. ANGLE) import //testing but do not have
    "location_tags.json", and so we don't want to try and upload the tags
    for their tests.
    And, some build configs may simply turn off generation altogether.

thin_lto_enable_optimizations
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:129

toolkit_views
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/ui.gni:33

    True means the UI is built using the "views" framework.

treat_warnings_as_errors
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:50

    Default to warnings as errors for default workflow, where we catch
    warnings with known toolchains. Allow overriding this e.g. for Chromium
    builds on Linux that could use a different version of the compiler.
    With GCC, warnings in no-Chromium code are always not treated as errors.

use_afl
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:75

    Compile for fuzzing with AFL.

use_android_unwinder_v2
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:33

    Set to true to use the android unwinder V2 implementation.

use_aura
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/ui.gni:28

    Indicates if Aura is enabled. Aura is a low-level windowing library, sort
    of a replacement for GDI or GTK.

use_cfi_cast
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:115

    Enable checks for bad casts: derived cast and unrelated cast.
    TODO(krasin): remove this, when we're ready to add these checks by default.
    https://crbug.com/626794

use_cfi_diag
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:64

    Print detailed diagnostics when Control Flow Integrity detects a violation.

use_cfi_icall
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:61

use_cfi_recover
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:68

    Let Control Flow Integrity continue execution instead of crashing when
    printing diagnostics (use_cfi_diag = true).

use_chromium_rust_toolchain
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/rust.gni:29

    Use experimental Rust toolchain built in-tree. See //tools/rust. For now,
    only use it for linux targets. The package only has prebuilt libs for linux.
    More targets will be added later.
   
    Ideally this should check `current_os` so that e.g. Android builds will use
    the Android toolchain for target artifacts and the Chromium Rust toolchain
    for host artifacts. Currently there is an std mixup in //build/rust/std that
    prevents this.
   
    TODO(https://crbug.com/1245714): fix std handling and check `current_os`.

use_clang_coverage
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/coverage/coverage.gni:23

use_clang_diagnostics_format
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/BUILD.gn:43

    Set this to use clang-style diagnostics format instead of MSVC-style, which
    is useful in e.g. Emacs compilation mode.
    E.g.:
     Without this, clang emits a diagnostic message like this:
       foo/bar.cc(12,34): error: something went wrong
     and with this switch, clang emits it like this:
       foo/bar.cc:12:34: error: something went wrong

use_clang_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/profiling/profiling.gni:10

use_clang_profiling_inside_sandbox
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:180

use_custom_libcxx
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:15

use_custom_libcxx_for_host
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:25

    Use libc++ instead of stdlibc++ when using the host_cpu toolchain, even if
    use_custom_libcxx is false. This is useful for cross-compiles where a custom
    toolchain for the target_cpu has been set as the default toolchain, but
    use_custom_libcxx should still be true when building for the host.  The
    expected usage is to set use_custom_libcxx=false and
    use_custom_libcxx_for_host=true in the passed in buildargs.

use_cxx11
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:89

    Allow projects that wish to stay on C++11 to override Chromium's default.

use_dbus
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:31

use_debug_fission
    Current value (from the default) = "default"
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:81

    use_debug_fission: whether to use split DWARF debug info
    files. This can reduce link time significantly, but is incompatible
    with some utilities such as icecc and ccache. Requires gold and
    gcc >= 4.8 or clang.
    http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission
   
    This is a placeholder value indicating that the code below should set
    the default.  This is necessary to delay the evaluation of the default
    value expression until after its input values such as use_gold have
    been set, e.g. by a toolchain_args() block.

use_dummy_lastchange
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/util/lastchange.gni:9

use_dwarf5
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:165

    Enable DWARF v5.

use_external_fuzzing_engine
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:78

    Compile for fuzzing with an external engine (e.g., Grammarinator).

use_full_pdb_paths
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:173

    Override this to put full paths to PDBs in Windows PE files. This helps
    windbg and Windows Performance Analyzer with finding the PDBs in some local-
    build scenarios. This is never needed for bots or official builds. Because
    this puts the output directory in the DLLs/EXEs it breaks build determinism.
    Bugs have been reported to the windbg/WPA teams and this workaround will be
    removed when they are fixed.

use_ghash
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:119

    Turn this on to use ghash feature of lld for faster debug link on Windows.
    http://blog.llvm.org/2018/01/improving-link-time-on-windows-with.html

use_gio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:33

use_glib
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ui.gni:36

use_gold
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:221

    Whether to use the gold linker from binutils instead of lld or bfd.

use_goma
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:9

    Set to true to enable distributed compilation using Goma.

use_goma_rust
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/rust.gni:60

    Use goma for Rust builds. Experimental. The only known problem is
    b/193072381, but then again, we don't expect a build speedup before much
    more work is done.

use_goma_thin_lto
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:95

    If true, use Goma for ThinLTO code generation where applicable.

use_gtk
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/linux/gtk/gtk.gni:9

    Whether or not we should use libgtk.

use_icf
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:190

    Set to true to use icf, Identical Code Folding.
   
    icf=all is broken in older golds, see
    https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17704
    chromeos binutils has been patched with the fix, so always use icf there.
    The bug only affects x86 and x64, so we can still use ICF when targeting
    other architectures.
   
    lld doesn't have the bug.

use_jacoco_coverage
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/coverage/coverage.gni:27

    Enables JaCoCo Java code coverage.

use_java_goma
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:26

    TODO(crbug.com/726475): true if use_goma = true in the future.

use_large_pdbs
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/BUILD.gn:48

    Indicates whether to use /pdbpagesize:8192 to allow PDBs larger than 4 GiB.
    This requires updated debugging and profiling tools which are not widely
    distributed yet which is why it is currently opt-in.

use_libfuzzer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:72

    Compile for fuzzing with LLVM LibFuzzer.
    See http://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/libfuzzer

use_libinput
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:37

    Determines if we're willing to link against libinput

use_libjpeg_turbo
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/libjpeg.gni:11

    Uses libjpeg_turbo as the jpeg implementation. Has no effect if
    use_system_libjpeg is set.

use_lld
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:42

    Set to true to use lld, the LLVM linker.
    In late bring-up on macOS (see docs/mac_lld.md).
    Tentatively used on iOS, except in cronet builds (cronet still supports
    32-bit builds, which lld doesn't support).
    The default linker everywhere else.

use_locally_built_instrumented_libraries
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:47

    Use dynamic libraries instrumented by one of the sanitizers instead of the
    standard system libraries. Set this flag to build the libraries from source.

use_lto_in_rustc_linking
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/rust.gni:55

    Use LTO when using rustc to link binaries. Experimental. Currently incompatible
    with the options we use in our C++ toolchain to split LTO units.
    This has no effect on the production of normal Chrome binaries, which are
    linked by clang/lld rather than rustc.
    https://crbug.com/1229419

use_ozone
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:13

use_perfetto_client_library
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:53

use_rbe
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/rbe.gni:17

    Set to true to enable remote compilation using reclient (deprecated).

use_remoteexec
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/rbe.gni:14

    Set to true to enable remote compilation using reclient.

use_rts
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/rts.gni:4

    For more info about RTS, please see
    //docs/testing/regression-test-selection.md

use_rtti
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:80

    Build with C++ RTTI enabled. Chromium builds without RTTI by default,
    but some sanitizers are known to require it, like CFI diagnostics
    and UBsan variants.

use_sanitizer_configs_without_instrumentation
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:105

    When enabled, only relevant sanitizer defines are set, but compilation
    happens with no extra flags. This is useful when in component build
    enabling sanitizers only in some of the components.

use_sanitizer_coverage
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:169

use_sysroot
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/sysroot.gni:24

    Controls default is_linux sysroot. If set to true, and sysroot
    is empty, default sysroot is calculated.

use_system_freetype
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/freetype/freetype.gni:13

    Blink needs a recent and properly build-configured FreeType version to
    support OpenType variations, color emoji and avoid security bugs. By default
    we ship and link such a version as part of Chrome. For distributions that
    prefer to keep linking to the version the system, FreeType must be newer
    than version 2.7.1 and have color bitmap support compiled in. WARNING:
    System FreeType configurations other than as described WILL INTRODUCE TEXT
    RENDERING AND SECURITY REGRESSIONS.

use_system_harfbuzz
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/harfbuzz-ng/harfbuzz.gni:11

    Blink uses a cutting-edge version of Harfbuzz; most Linux distros do not
    contain a new enough version of the code to work correctly. However,
    ChromeOS chroots (i.e, real ChromeOS builds for devices) do contain a
    new enough version of the library, and so this variable exists so that
    ChromeOS can build against the system lib and keep binary sizes smaller.

use_system_libjpeg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libjpeg.gni:7

    Uses system libjpeg. If true, overrides use_libjpeg_turbo.

use_text_section_splitting
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:149

    This argument is to control whether enabling text section splitting in the
    final binary. When enabled, the separated text sections with prefix
    '.text.hot', '.text.unlikely', '.text.startup' and '.text.exit' will not be
    merged to '.text' section. This allows us to identify the hot code section
    ('.text.hot') in the binary which may be mlocked or mapped to huge page to
    reduce TLB misses which gives performance improvement on cpu usage.
    The gold linker by default has text section splitting enabled.

use_thin_lto
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:89

use_udev
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:29

    libudev usage. This currently only affects the content layer.

using_mismatched_sample_profile
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:102

    Whether we're using a sample profile collected on an architecture different
    than the one we're compiling for.
   
    It's currently not possible to collect AFDO profiles on anything but
    x86{,_64}.

v8_current_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = "x64"
      From //build/config/v8_target_cpu.gni:60

    This argument is declared here so that it can be overridden in toolchains.
    It should never be explicitly set by the user.

v8_target_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/v8_target_cpu.gni:33

    This arg is used when we want to tell the JIT-generating v8 code
    that we want to have it generate for an architecture that is different
    than the architecture that v8 will actually run on; we then run the
    code under an emulator. For example, we might run v8 on x86, but
    generate arm code and run that under emulation.
   
    This arg is defined here rather than in the v8 project because we want
    some of the common architecture-specific args (like arm_float_abi or
    mips_arch_variant) to be set to their defaults either if the current_cpu
    applies *or* if the v8_current_cpu applies.
   
    As described below, you can also specify the v8_target_cpu to use
    indirectly by specifying a `custom_toolchain` that contains v8_$cpu in the
    name after the normal toolchain.
   
    For example, `gn gen --args="custom_toolchain=...:clang_x64_v8_arm64"`
    is equivalent to setting --args=`v8_target_cpu="arm64"`. Setting
    `custom_toolchain` is more verbose but makes the toolchain that is
    (effectively) being used explicit.
   
    v8_target_cpu can only be used to target one architecture in a build,
    so if you wish to build multiple copies of v8 that are targeting
    different architectures, you will need to do something more
    complicated involving multiple toolchains along the lines of
    custom_toolchain, above.

visual_studio_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/win/visual_studio_version.gni:9

    Path to Visual Studio. If empty, the default is used which is to use the
    automatic toolchain in depot_tools. If set, you must also set the
    visual_studio_version and wdk_path.

visual_studio_version
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/win/visual_studio_version.gni:13

    Version of Visual Studio pointed to by the visual_studio_path.
    Currently always "2015".

wdk_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/win/visual_studio_version.gni:17

    Directory of the Windows driver kit. If visual_studio_path is empty, this
    will be auto-filled.

win_enable_cfg_guards
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/control_flow_guard.gni:10

    Set this to true to enable generation of CFG indirect call dispatch
    guards.

win_linker_timing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/BUILD.gn:20

    Turn this on to have the linker output extra timing information.

windows_sdk_path
    Current value (from the default) = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10"
      From //build/config/win/visual_studio_version.gni:22

    Full path to the Windows SDK, not including a backslash at the end.
    This value is the default location, override if you have a different
    installation location.
